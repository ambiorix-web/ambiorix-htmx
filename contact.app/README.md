## Contact.app

in chapter 3 of [hypermedia systems](https://hypermedia.systems/a-web-1-0-application/), the authors talk of a simple contact management web app called Contact.app whose functionality is:

- view a list of contacts, including first name, last name, phone and email address
- search the contacts
- add a new contact
- view the details of a contact
- edit the details of a contact
- delete a contact

this example is a variation of that app, with all the said functionality.
